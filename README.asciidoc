wec-infinity
============

Infinity engine AI scripts.

// vim: set syntax=asciidoc:
// vim: set spell:

== Details

Supported games:

- Baldur's Gate 2

== Requirements

- http://cygwin.com/setup.exe[Cygwin] with the following packages:
** make
** wget
** sed
- http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java Runtime] (JRE is fine)

== Installation

- https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git[Setup Git]
- Clone the repository in your game directory: `git clone
  https://github.com/herve-quiroz/wec-infinity.git`
- Run Cygwin
- From the `wec-infinity` directory run: `make install`

The first time you run the above command, the needed tools will be downloaded
and installed (e.g. http://fmpp.sourceforge.net[FMPP], the `AICompile.exe` for
each supported game). This should take only a few minutes and will happen only
once.

The scripts will then be compiled and installed into your game directory. Next
time you run the game you will be able to use the compiled scripts from the
character screen.
